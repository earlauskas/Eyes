# Eyes
## Description of Project
### This activity is an exploration into mouse events, specifically with mousemove. My task was to add a second "eye" element that follows the mouse as it moves around the screen. 
## How to Run
### To run this activity, simply load the HTML file onto your browser. Make sure you have this loaded in a full browser window for optimal results. Drag your mouse around the screen and watch the "eyes" follow your mouse movements.
## Roadmap of Future Improvements
### I would like to include more mouse events in this activity, namely having the background change color on mouseclick.
